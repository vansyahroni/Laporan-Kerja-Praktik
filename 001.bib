abstract = {Today every small and large industry use the robotic manipulator to complete the various task like as picking and placing, welding process, painting and material handling but to complete these task one of the most important problem is to get the desire position and orientation of the robotic manipulators. There are two method for analyzing the robotic manipulator one is forward kinematic analysis and another is inverse kinematic analysis. This project aim to model the forward and inverse kinematic of 5 DOF and 6 DOF robotic manipulator. A movement flow planning is designed and further evaluate all the DH parameter to calculate the desire position and orientation of the end effector. Forward kinematics is simple to design but for inverse kinematic solution traditional method (iterative, DH notation, transformation) are used. And compare the result with analytical solution and see there are acceptable error. A FK and IK solution of aspect robotic manipulator are successfully modeled.},
